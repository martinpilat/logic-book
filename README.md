# Lecture Notes on Propositional and Predicate Logic

This is a first version of a lecture on propositional and predicate logic. The lecture notes are incomplete as of yet, but the goal is to add notes for one lecture every week.

As the book is a work in progress, it may contain errors. If you find one, do not hesitate to create an issue. Also, any other comments on the text are welcome.
