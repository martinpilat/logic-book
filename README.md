# Lecture Notes on Propositional and Predicate Logic

This is a first version of lecture on propositional and predicate logic. The lecture notes are incomplete as of yet, but the goal is to add notes for one lecture every week.

As the book is a work in progress, it may contain error, if you find one, do not hesitate to create an issue. Also any other comments to the text are welcome.
